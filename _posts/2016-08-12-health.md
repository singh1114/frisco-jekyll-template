Today, 12th May at 08: 00 PM, our Prime Minister gave a speech regarding the idea of making India self-sufficient. This
Place will help Indian Producers to reach out to the Indian Consumers in a well defined way.

### How it will work?

We will try to reach out to an Indian Producer from different sector everyday who is trying to sell there produce. We will
share the details of the Consumers who want to buy the product with the producer and they can find out the way in which they
want to connect.

Reach out to us using Twitter, Instagram or Email if you know someone who is a producer and share this with your friends.

Together we will a few small circles which are self sufficient in themselves.
